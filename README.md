# landing-page

This project was a reintroduction to CSS.

While temping to lean on a design framework like bootstrap, I wanted to force myself to style this simple landing page mockup with pure HTML and CSS.

And I did.

And I think it looks pretty nice.

I could have embelished a bit, created a "real" mock product, and add my own styling.

But for me, the true purpose of the exercise was to follow the specs given in the "Resources" folder and design the page as close to spec as I could.

Creativity can come later. The purpose, for me, was to nail the layout as instructed to prove that I could.

Onward.
